# lo-fly

A social media web-application for archiving flyers for live performances and the media from said events

# What is lo-fly?

lo-fly is a open-source social media web-application whose main purpose is to archive and catalog the amazing and unique promotional art of Flyers. Bands, artists, venues, photographers, videographers, and collectives can create accounts and post the promotional art for both past and upcomming shows. Scheduled shows can link to the details so fans can attend. Past shows link to a gallery of media from the event. Media submissions can be added manually by the page owner or submitted by fans and then approved by the owner.

# Holy shit, that's so Cool!

I know right! As a musician myself I realized that the flyers, photos, video, and messages from the various shows I've played over the last 10 years are scattered across blogs, Facebook, Tumblr, youTube, Instagram, and who knows where else some really cool stuff is hiding. That, and flyers are the fucking coolest!.

# So, how to I get lo-fly?

Well, it doesn't exist yet. I know, but since you are reading this on gitHub theres a pretty good chance your a programmer, coder, developer, or hacker, so... Help me build a thing?
